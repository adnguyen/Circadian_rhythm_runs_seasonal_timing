This year is a little different because I'm not doing respirometry on all of the samples. Therefore, the uniqueIDs will be a little different. 

For genetic controls, they'll be labeled by host (H or A), cohort day (1-20), then by individual number (1-30ish)



Creating wells

```{r}

letters<-rep(c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H"),12)

num<-sort(rep(seq(1,12,1),8))

wells<-paste(letters,num,sep="")
```

Sampling for cohort day 6 (2018-08-21)

```{r}
A6<-data.frame(sample(wells,60),treatment=c(rep("RT",30),rep("SO",30)))
write.csv(A6,"../Data/randomizing/2018_collection_year/2018-09-04_apple_day6_cohort_2018-08-21.csv")

```
