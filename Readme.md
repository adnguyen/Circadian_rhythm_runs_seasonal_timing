### Meta data for critical datasets   

**2017-08-24_rhagoletis_data_sheet.xlsx** : master dataset where we collated different sources of data (respirometry, mass, and trikinetics annotations)  

* Maggot_collections tab: Details of fruit collections, maggot collections, and when to process at different times of the workflow  
  * Site: broad site name 
  * Site_name: micro site name
  * Host: host fruit
  * Collect_fruit: when we collected fruit; should only be 2 dates to indicate apple and haw collection
  * Collect_day: cohort day 
  * Collect_larvae: collection date of larvae for that cohort
  * Petri_dish: petri dish number; we tried to put 100 maggots per dish
  * Collector: person who collected; AN = Andrew Nguyen, PE= Pepa, TG = Tatiana, CH= Chelsea, KL= Kylie
  * Petri_density: number of maggots we placed in that petri dish
  * Day10_weights_date: day 10 date for when to weigh and purge a given cohort
  * Day11_respirometry_date: day 11 date for when we measure co2 for a given cohort
  * Day14_weights_date : day 14 date for when to weigh and purge a given cohort
  * Day15_respirometry_date: day 15 date for when we measure co2 for a given cohort   
* Data_collect tab: Datasheet where we entered cohort details; weights, purge times, and respirometry data; trikinetics handling details; as well as notes   
  * Ind_ID: initial numerical ID
  * tape : tape associated with Ind_ID
  * Site_name: general site name
  * mass_day10: mass values at day 10 in mgs
  * purge_time_1: purge time in military time (hours: minutes) at day 10
  * purge1: going to convert military time to hours decimals at day 10
  * collection_date: Date the fruit was collected 
  * day10: day 10 date
  * cohort_date: initial cohort date from which we collected maggots
  * cohort_day: the cohort day 
  * Host: host fruit ; apple or haw
  * Li-cor_1: respirometry machine we used for each sample 
  * resp_time_1: time of when we measured sample respirometrically day 11
  * resp_day11: raw respirometry values day 11
  * mass_day14: mass values at day 11 in mgs 
  * purge_time_2: purge times in military time for the cohort at day 14
  * resp_time_2: time of when we measured sample respirometrically day 15  
  * resp_day15:  raw respirometry values day 15
  * Li_cor2: additional licor id if different licor was used between days
  * treatment_day15: date cohort was split into one of three treatments 
  * exit_fridge_date: date silmulated overwinter cohorts were removed from fridge
  * notes: notes for respirometry; weights; indication of deaths and observations
  * Resp_code: either 0 or 1, depending on if CO2 was produced during respirometry 
  * treatment: whether sample was split into the genetic control, rearing temperature (RT eclosion), or in the fridge (simulated overwintering)  
  * uniqueID: for apple, the ID is a combination of cohort day, first letter of tape color, and Ind_ID number; for haw, it is the same thing but uniqueIDs start with an "h" to indicate haw
  * eclosion_date: eclosion day defined as an adult at least 50% emerged from pupal case. 
  * eclosion_days: number of days from maggot collection(cohort date) until eclosion_date
  * well_id: if in RT or fridge treatment, the well id in a 96 well plate set up 
  * organism: fly or parasitic wasp

  * Free_run_exit_time: the time when a sample exited the free-run experiment 
  * notes_3: notes for free run experiment
